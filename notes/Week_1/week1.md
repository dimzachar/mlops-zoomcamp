- **Design**: This is the stage where we decide if Machine Learning (ML) is the right tool for solving our problem. For example, if we want to predict the duration of a taxi trip, we need to determine whether we need to use ML or if a simpler rule-based model would suffice.
- **Train**: If we decide that ML is necessary, then we train and evaluate the best model in this stage.
- **Operate**: This stage involves model deployment, management, and monitoring.

MLOps is helpful in all these stages, providing best practices for bringing Machine Learning to production.

- **MLOps**: This is a set of principles and practices for efficient management of the end-to-end Machine Learning lifecycle from experiments to productionization. It includes version management of both data and model artifacts, operationalizing the development and release cycle of ML models in a CICD ecosystem, and monitoring the performance of models in production to maintain effectiveness.
- **Environment Setup**: This involves spinning up an EC2 instance, connecting to the Ubuntu EC2 server, and configuring the Ubuntu server. The configuration includes installing Anaconda, Docker, and Docker Compose. Finally, the VS Code setup is done for development.
