# Chapter 1: Introduction to ML Deployment

This chapter introduces the concept of machine learning deployment and the Envelopes platform that automates monitoring and reproducibility, and streamlines the deployment process. The key takeaway from this chapter is understanding the importance of automating model monitoring and reproducibility tasks in machine learning deployment and how the Envelopes platform can help in this process.

# Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning in Production

## Course Overview

Welcome to the first chapter of the course on Machine Learning in Production! This chapter serves as an introduction to the world of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) and the three-stage process of machine learning projects. 

## What is MLOps?

MLOps, or Machine Learning Operations, is a practice for collaboration and communication between data scientists and operations professionals to help manage production machine learning (or deep learning) workflows. It's a compound of "machine learning" and "operations" and aims to standardize and streamline the continuous delivery of ML applications.


## The Three-Stage Process for Machine Learning Projects

- **Design**: This is the stage where we decide if Machine Learning (ML) is the right tool for solving our problem. For example, if we want to predict the duration of a taxi trip, we need to determine whether we need to use ML or if a simpler rule-based model would suffice.
- **Train**: If we decide that ML is necessary, then we use the prepared data to train our machine learning model. This involves selecting an appropriate algorithm, setting the hyperparameters, and then train and evaluate the best model in this stage.
- **Operate**: Once the model is trained and validated, the final step involves model deployment, management, and monitoring.

MLOps is helpful in all these stages, providing best practices for bringing Machine Learning to production.


## Why MLOps?

MLOps helps ensure model performance and automates processes for team collaboration in machine learning. It's a powerful tool that can help teams streamline their machine learning workflows and ensure that their models are performing at their best.
