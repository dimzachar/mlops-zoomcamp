Summary:
In this video, the presenter walks through the process of setting up a pipeline for AWS using Terraform. They start by creating an S3 bucket using Terraform with output variables and describing how to name and reference variables in Terraform. They then create a bucket to store models and configure ECI registry, along with dependencies for Lambda function creation, including S3 bucket and ECR repository. The presenter also explains how to manage code repositories and dependencies in monorepo style, and provides an explanation of Lambda handler and Docker packaging for AWS. The video also covers configuring AWS ECR image as a data source in Terraform, introducing the use of tfvars files in Terraform, and describing environment variables and file paths for a Lambda function. The presenter walks through the process of building and pushing a Docker image for Lambda configuration, and describes the configuration of a Lambda function for video creators. The video also covers creating AWS IAM role and policies for Kinesis and Lambda, along with steps to create policies and assign roles in AWS. The presenter describes Lambda permissions and policies for S3 and CloudWatch, and provides an explanation of module referencing and Lambda function properties. The video also covers creating and using an ML model bucket and stream, along with the workflow for creating infrastructure, training models, and deploying applications. The presenter walks through the process of creating and referencing a Lambda function with CloudWatch and Kinesis, and provides an explanation of the AWS Lambda deployment process. Finally, the presenter covers fixing errors in Lambda
