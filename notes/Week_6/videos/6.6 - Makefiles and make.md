Summary:
In this video, we will be discussing the use of Makefiles for engineering practices. We will start by introducing the concept of Makefiles and how they can be used for building, testing, and publishing with dependencies. We will then demonstrate a local attack and image naming issue and show how parameterizing and optimizing image building in bash can help resolve these issues. Next, we will explain how to use Makefiles for Docker image publishing and provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up pre-commit hooks and Makefiles for code quality. By the end of this video, you will have a better understanding of how Makefiles can be used to streamline your engineering practices and improve code quality.
