Summary:
In this video, we will be reviewing the process of testing engineering practices using local stack and Docker. We will start by setting up local stack for AWS Kinesis and configuring a local Kinesis stream endpoint for code access. Next, we will configure and test Kinesis stream integration in Docker. We will also test a script for Kinesis stream with Boto3 and examine the Kinesis response decoding and integration. Finally, we will provide an overview of testing, code quality, and using make files. This video is perfect for anyone looking to improve their engineering practices and learn how to test Kinesis stream integration using local stack and Docker.
