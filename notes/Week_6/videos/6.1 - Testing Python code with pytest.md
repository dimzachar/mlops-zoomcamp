Summary:
In this video, the presenter provides a review of module 6, which focuses on adding tests to existing code. They then demonstrate how to set up unit tests with Pytest in VS Code and configure and create tests for Python using Pi test. The video also covers debugging code with global variables and long functions. The presenter then moves on to discuss code implementation and class creation for a model service, loading and testing a model in Docker, and testing the model's base64 decoding logic with a separate function. They also demonstrate unit testing with a mock model class and parameterizing model value and testing lambda handler. The video then covers code changes and callbacks for predictions, adjusting code for Kinesis client and callback, and provides an explanation of unit tests and an introduction to integration tests. Overall, this video provides a comprehensive overview of adding tests to existing code and demonstrates various techniques and tools for testing Python code.
