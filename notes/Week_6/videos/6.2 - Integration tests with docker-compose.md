Summary:
In this video, the presenter discusses various techniques for refactoring code to make it easier to test and adding tests to ensure code quality. They demonstrate how to turn tests into proper tests with asserts and use the deep diff library to compare dictionaries in Python. The presenter also shows how to fix a model and test it with the deep diff library, and how to remove S3 dependency for testing by using the local file system. They explain how to set up the model location and automate testing, and create a script to build and test a Docker image. The presenter emphasizes the importance of using the date for tagging instead of just the Git commit hash. They also explain how to mount volumes and test with Docker Compose, and provide an explanation of the Docker Compose error code with set -e. Finally, the presenter reviews Bash syntax for error handling and testing Kinesis callback, and demonstrates how to test locally with Kinesis and S3.
