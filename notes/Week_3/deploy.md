# Chapter 4: Deploying Workflows using Prefect Projects

This chapter covers how to deploy workflows using Prefect for productionizing. It includes instructions on configuring the project, deploying with the pull step, and running a flow with a worker pool. It also explores setting up deployment from GitHub for collaboration purposes.

## Deploying Workflows with Prefect 2.0

Once you've set up your environment and defined your workflows, you can deploy them using Prefect. Here's how:

- **Initialize Your Prefect Project:** Navigate to the directory where your Prefect project is located and run the following command:

```
prefect project init
```

This command creates a `.prefectignore` file, a `deployment.yaml` file, a `prefect.yaml` file, and a hidden `.prefect` folder.


- **Create a Work Pool:** From the Prefect UI, create a new Work Pool. This is where your flows will be run.


- **Deploy Your Flow:** You can deploy your flow using the prefect deploy command. Here's an example:

```
prefect deploy orchestrate.py:main_flow -n nyc_taxi -p zoompool
```

Make sure you provide the correct PATH to the .py file.

- **Start a Worker:** You can start a worker that will run your flows using the prefect worker start command. Here's an example:

```
prefect worker start -p zoompool -t process
```

If you used the Prefect UI to create the work pool, then you don't need to specify `-t process`.

- **Run Your Deployment:** Finally, you can start a run of your deployment. You can do this from the Prefect UI, or using the prefect deployment run command. Here's an example:

```
prefect deployment run main_flow/nyc_taxi
```

Now, your flow is deployed and running on the Prefect server. You can monitor its progress and manage it through the Prefect UI.
