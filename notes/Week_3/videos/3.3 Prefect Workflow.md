# Summary:

In this video, we will learn how to productionize a Jupyter notebook into a Python script using Prefect. The video will start with a review of the code overview and data import for an ML model. We will then review the data read-in, feature engineering, and model training process. Next, we will add orchestration and observability with Prefect. The video will explain how to use caching and add decorators in ML flow. Finally, we will give an overview of using Prefect for data flow orchestration. Overall, this video will provide a comprehensive guide on how to use Prefect to productionize a Jupyter notebook into a Python script for an ML model.
