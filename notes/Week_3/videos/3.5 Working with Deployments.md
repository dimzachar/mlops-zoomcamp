# Summary:

Hello everyone, welcome to our video on Prefect deployments and S3 data retrieval explained. In this video, we will be discussing how to create and access AWS credentials, S3 bucket, and how to use them in Prefect. We will start with a review of Prefect deployments and S3 data retrieval, explaining the basics of how they work and why they are important. We will then move on to creating AWS credentials and S3 bucket, including a step-by-step guide on how to do this. Next, we will show you how to create and save an S3 bucket object using Python code. We will also provide an overview of how to use the S3 bucket block in Prefect, including loading local data and setting up deployment. We will then demonstrate how to create and deploy an S3 file with a markdown artifact, and how to customize parameters for flow runs. Finally, we will provide a tutorial on setting up schedules for deployments. By the end of this video, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to create and access AWS credentials, S3 bucket, and how to use them in Prefect. So, let's get started!
