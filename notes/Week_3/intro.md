# Chapter 1: Introduction to Orchestration and Machine Learning Pipelines with Prefect

## Introduction

This chapter provides a deep dive into the concept of workflow orchestration in the context of machine learning projects. It elaborates on the challenges posed by complex systems, including managing large datasets, maintaining data integrity, and streamlining computational processes. 

Workflow orchestration in machine learning involves coordinating various tasks in a system, ensuring they execute in the correct order, at the right time, and under the right conditions.

## What is Prefect 2.0? 

Prefect 2.0 is a powerful tool that helps manage these complexities, increasing efficiency and reducing errors in your workflows. It provides a Pythonic API for defining tasks and their dependencies, and it handles all the tricky parts of execution for you.

## Key Features of Prefect 2.0

One of the standout features of Prefect 2.0 is "Code as Workflows". This feature allows any function written in Python to be turned into a task or flow that can be orchestrated by Prefect. This opens up a world of possibilities for data scientists and engineers, allowing them to focus on writing their Python code, while Prefect takes care of the orchestration.

"Dynamic Workflows" is another powerful feature in Prefect 2.0. It allows for the creation of workflows that can generate any task at runtime. This flexibility makes it possible to handle a wide range of use cases with less code.

Prefect 2.0 also comes with "Batteries Included", providing everything you need for a complete orchestration platform. This includes features like scheduling, retries, logging, caching, and more.

Finally, Prefect 2.0 introduces a "Reimagined UI". This new user interface allows users to customize their view of their stack, providing a more personalized and efficient way to manage workflows.
