# Summary:

In this video, we will be exploring the process of building a Grafana dashboard by creating various artifacts. We will begin by downloading and loading data, performing basic statistics, and calculating targets. Following that, we will delve into data preprocessing and creating a baseline model. We will then move on to selecting features and training a linear regression model. Finally, we will review the quality of our model and create a reference data set. Throughout the video, we will explain each step briefly to give you a better understanding of the process.
