# Summary:

In this video, we will be creating a database and tables for dummy metrics calculation. We will start by preparing the database and creating tables with dummy data. Next, we will insert timestamp values into the database table. Finally, we will set up and access a PostgreSQL database for Grafana dashboard. This video will provide a step-by-step guide on how to create a functional database and tables for dummy metrics calculation, and how to set up and access a PostgreSQL database for Grafana dashboard.
