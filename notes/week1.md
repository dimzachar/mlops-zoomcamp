- **Design**: This is the stage where we decide if Machine Learning (ML) is the right tool for solving our problem. For example, if we want to predict the duration of a taxi trip, we need to determine whether we need to use ML or if a simpler rule-based model would suffice.
- **Train**: If we decide that ML is necessary, then we train and evaluate the best model in this stage.
- **Operate**: This stage involves model deployment, management, and monitoring.

MLOps is helpful in all these stages, providing best practices for bringing Machine Learning to production.
